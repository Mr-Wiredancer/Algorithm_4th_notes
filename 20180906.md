# 1.3 Bags, Queues, and Stack

This segments talks about the three basic data structures that is one level higher than primary types.

These fundamental data structures is **prior** for collecting number of objects. They are like a containers of object. This is the basic characters that a data structure should have.

Also, data structure has several other characters and goals:

- Abstract
- Efficiency

    For some data structure.

- iteration

    It describes that clients can get data from head to the tail of the data structure.

- generics
  
    This is limited to Java(there are other language that has same mechanism e.g. c++). It actually is template and thereby clients can use class with different types of objects.

- more......

Rest of this chapter will focus on the implementations(designing APIs and efficiency of implementations) of these three data structures.

## APIs

Bags

```java
public class Bag<Item> implements Iterable<Item>
{
    Bag();
    void add(Item item);
    boolean isEmpty();
    int size();
};
```

```java
public class Queue<Item> implements Iterable<Item>
{
    Queue();
    void enqueue(Item item);
    Item dequeue();
    boolean isEmpty();
    int size();
};
```

```java
public class Stack<Item> implements Iterable<Item>
{
    Stack();
    void push(Item item);
    Item pop();
    int size();
};
```

## Generics

An ADTs should be able to contain **any** type of objects. **Collections which only allow to contain one type are useless** because when collections needs to contain other types, we may need to copy and paste the same code again and again and change type of containers.

```java
Stack<Item>
```

The "Item" is a **type variable** or **type parameter** which means that "Item" changes according to clients.

```java
Stack<Integer>
```

Now "Item" is equal to type "Integer"

This sounds like that Java compiler will automaticly write the different version of collections for us.

Thanks for type parameter, we do not have to know the specific type in order to write the code.

## Autoboxing

It is a technique of Java. Since the most of techniques of Java require **object** and primary type **is not object**, Java implicitly convert they to object. This is Autoboxing.

Unboxing is opposite operation of boxing.

object of primary type -> primary type

## Iterable collections

Lots of applications require a way to process each object in the collections. Iterable means each object can be get and change. It is an important character for some data structure.

In addition, client do not need to care about the implementation of collections. If collection is iterable, each object can be process in this collection.

## Bag

Bag is a collection that

- we can just add things into bag
- we cannot remove things from bag
- it is iterable
- the order of items is not important

## Queue

Queue is a collection that

- first-in-first-out
- the order of collection is the item coming into collection first process first
- iterable

## Stack

Stack is a collection that

- last-in-first-out
- the order is reversed
- iterable

one of example is arithmetic expression evaluation using Dijkstraâ€™s Two-Stack Algorithm.

One stack is for operands and one stack is for operators.

>- Push operands onto the operand stack.
>- Push operators onto the operator stack.
>- Ignore left parentheses.
>- On encountering a right parenthesis, pop an operator, pop the requisite number of operands, and push onto the operand stack the result of applying that operator to those operands.

This algorithm is **only** for full parenthesized expression. I will implement this algorithm later when I implement Stack.

## Implementing collections

Now we start to implement these data structures.

The first one is FixedCapacityStackOfStrings which is basic implementation of stack and only collects String(object) in it.

```java
public class FixedCapacityStackOfStrings{
    FixedCapacityStackOfStrings(int cap);
    void push(String item);
    String pop();
    boolean isEmpty();
    int size();
}
```

The advance of this implementation is that the time spending on push and pop is independent to the number of objects in the collections. Even though I have tons of objects in one container, I can push and pop immediately. But the first problem is that this implement is only for String. If I want a stack of other object, I need to write the similar code again.
