# Notes for 2018.9.5

At the first chapter of this book, it talks about Java programming language including some syntax and some concept.


## 1.1 Basic Programming Model

This part provide some basic knowledge of Java,  programming structure, and abstract. Since I am aleady familiar with these terms, I will skim it quickly and just look at the different part of language.

## 1.2 Data Abstract

Most of things in this part is about some API provide by booksite and about what is data abstract and why we need it. I skim it because I aleady fimiliar with the content and I just need to know which API provided.

## 1.3 Bag, Queues, and Stack

I will start from here and read the book carefully.

## Conclusion
One of the amazing things about this book is that it provide some helpful API that help me to avoid to care too much about the tangential problems. When I study algorithm using c++, it is a horrible experience(maybe) since some Data structure require to manipulate memory where the most unknown questions occur. Also, there are **tons** of problems about STL Library(Standard library for c++). When I compile my code, compiler always tell me some useless and mysterious information and I will spend about **half of the day** to find out the position of the problem.:sweat: I find out that Java provide the useful error massages. Therefore, it helps me to locate the line number of the incorrect code more easier: I can avoid to some awful problems and just focus on the implementations of algorithms.
